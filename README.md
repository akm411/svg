## AKM SVG Project
==================

My SVG project is a *digital "scrapbook."*

Each image represents a city where one of my family members lives.

The SVG shapes sit under the images, like the construction paper frames

you might use in an actual scrapbook.



The cities are:
- New York City
- Amsterdam
- Stamford, CT

They each link to:
- [NYC Wiki] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)
- [Amsterdam Wiki] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam)
- [Stamford Wiki] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_CT)
